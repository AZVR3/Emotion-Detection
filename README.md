# Emotion Detection Project

This is a small project that was completed as practice to using **tenserflow** and **opencv**.
I have really enjoyed this project overall and hope this helps out whoever is starting
out on learning opencv for their own smaller projects.

## Image training
The dataset was gathered from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset">kaggle</a>. Completed by _Johnathan Oheix_.
<br><br>
The image training can be configured through the following steps:
1. Organize the image datas.
   + Categorize them into its own respectful emotions.
   + The image data that you personally take will work better for your particular face but may not be as accurate for others.
2. Rearrange your organized dataset into a new folder.
3. Reroute the directory in **<model.py>** to the desired training folder.
   + Or you can simply replace the dataset in [images/training] if desired to do so.
4. Rerun the **<model.py>** to update the model to the new dataset.
5. Voila!

## Update
v1.0.0 - Completion of emotion detection. 
   + Issue detected was that the program was only optimized for windows.
   + Separate mac compatible code would have to be made.
<br>
v1.1.0 - To be arrived
   + Issue was resolved by adding "pip install tensorflow-macos" and "pip install tensorflow-metal". 
   + Code was further modified to be compatible with macOS as they don't have a compatible GPU with the normal tensorflow.
   + The model was built outside of the correct directory so if you want to update the model the directory must be redefined.

â€» NEVER CONFIGURE THE **<haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml>** AS THAT WOULD MAKE THE MODEL NOT BE ABLE TO UPDATE ITSELF.

## Closing notes

You are free to use this program as you want.
This program will not be accepting any form of branches but comments will 
be read when sent.

Happy coding!
